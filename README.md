# Intensity-Sensitive Image Quality Assessment (IQA) Metrics

We have developed four IQA metrics for assessing low-information images in fields such as radio astronomical imaging, medical imaging, and remote sensing. They are InTensity Weighted Structural SIMilarity (ITW-SSIM), Low-Information Similarity Index (LISI), augmented Low-Information Similarity Index (augLISI), and transient-oriented Low-Information Similarity Index (tLISI). Please see our papers in Section [Reference](https://github.com/egbdfX/Intensity-sensitive-IQAs/tree/main#reference) for more information.

## ITW-SSIM (itw.py)

ITW-SSIM function is written in Python.

```out = itw(x,y,type_str)``` calculates the ITW-SSIM value for image ```x``` and image ```y```. ```x``` and ```y``` must be of the same size and class, and both images have been normalised to the comparable intensity scale. The output ITW-SSIM, ```out```, is a scalar. The weighting mode ```type_str``` needs to be inputted with ```'Gau'``` for Gaussian-based weighting function, ```'tanh'``` for tanh-based weighting function, and ```'sigm'``` for sigmoid-based weighting function.

## LISI (lisi.py)

LISI function is written in Python.

```out = lisi(x,y)``` calculates the LISI value for image ```x``` and image ```y```. ```x``` and ```y``` must be of the same size and class, and both images have been normalised to the comparable intensity scale. The output LISI, ```out```, is a scalar.

## augLISI (auglisi.py)

augLISI function is written in Python.

```out = auglisi(x,y)``` calculates the augLISI value for image ```x``` and image ```y```. ```x``` and ```y``` must be of the same size and class, and both images have been normalised to the comparable intensity scale. The output augLISI, ```out```, is a scalar.

## tLISI (tlisi.py)

tLISI function is written in Python.

```out = tlisi(x,y,snap,maxx)``` calculates the tLISI value for difference image ```x``` and difference image ```y```, where ```x``` and ```y``` must be of the same size and class. ```snap``` is the reference snapshot image and ```maxx``` is the maximum pixel value in the sequential images.
